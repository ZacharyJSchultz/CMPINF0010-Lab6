# ZJ & RAF Co. Code of Conduct

“We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other. Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth: more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe.” - T'Challa, Black Panther

The diverse work of various contributors allow for developments in our code, so please respect the contributions of fellow collaborators. Failure to comply with our inclusivity policy may result in a ban from further developing our code.

### Be informative
